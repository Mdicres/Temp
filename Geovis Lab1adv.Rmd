## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
ggplot() +
    geom_sf(data =boulder, aes(color=Hydro_dis),
    fill = NA, alpha = .2) +
  scale_colour_gradientn(colours = terrain.colors(10)) +  
  theme_bw()
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
boulder %>%
  filter(DB ==  'Pano' | DB == 'Flickr') %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=DB, y=Hydro_dis)) + 
  geom_boxplot()
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
